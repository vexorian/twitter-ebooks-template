# twitter-ebooks-template
A ruby twitter ebooks bot template.

## twitter-bot-template

This is based on another project: [The twitter-bot-template](https://github.com/vexorian/twitter-bot-template). Most of the twitter-related work is done by that. In fact, the only difference between this project and the twitter-bot-template is in content.rb, which in reality works as a wrapper for the [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) gem.

Refer to twitter-bot-template's instructions (which hopefully exist by the time you are reading this) to know how to setup the bot. The main difference is that this one needs a model file to generate the text. For model file instructions refer to twitter_ebooks' documentation.

Hopefully we can have a complete ebooks bot tutorial one day.
